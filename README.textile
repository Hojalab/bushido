h1. Instant Rails App Template

To use: @rails myapp -m http://github.com/tsaleh/instant-rails-app/raw/master/template.rb@

This is the template I use on my new applications.  It's very specifically
geared for the tools I use, and includes some of my coding idioms.  The
"gold":http://github.com/tsaleh/instant-rails-app/tree/master/gold directory is
a great example of what an app created with this template will end up looking
like.

h2. This template includes:

h4. Full user system 

* Authentication via Authlogic, 
* Streamlined user registration initially requiring just email address
* User confirmation/activation

h4. Configured for Heroku

Including @.gems@ manifest and automatic app creation.

_This template will create a new, free, heroku app automatically.  *BEWARE*_

h4. User avatars in Amazon S3 via Paperclip

h4. Blueprint based default style
